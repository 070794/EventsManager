# EventsManager
Its a web application that helps user to get the information about the upcoming events.

## Getting Started

To get you started you can simply clone the repository and install the dependencies:

### Prerequisites

You need git to clone this repository. You can get git from
[http://git-scm.com/](http://git-scm.com/).

We also use a number of node.js tools to initialize. You must have node.js and
its package manager (npm) installed.  You can get them from [http://nodejs.org/](http://nodejs.org/).

### Clone gitdash

Clone the gitdash repository using [git]:

```
git clone https: https://github.com/070794/EventsManager/
cd EventsManager
```

### Install Dependencies

We have two kinds of dependencies in this project: tools and angular framework code.  The tools help
us manage and test the application.

* We get the tools we depend upon via `npm`, the [node package manager][npm].
* We get the angular code via `bower`, a [client-side code package manager][bower].

```
npm install 
bower install

```
If you clone this repo you would already have these present.

### Run the Application

We have preconfigured the project with a simple development web server.  The simplest way to start
this server is:

```
node Server.js
```
Now browse to the app at `http://localhost:3000/`.
